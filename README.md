# Project: AML Single Cell Sequencing 

Project Aims: 

1. To learn single cell RNA-seq techniques using Seurat R package
2. To annotate AML cell types from published single cell RNA-seq data (see data sources)
3. To build classification model using deep neural network for AML and normal cell annotation.
4. To collect the AML buld RNA-seq data and related clincial information for AML buld RNA-seq deconvolution and clinical outcome correlation.
